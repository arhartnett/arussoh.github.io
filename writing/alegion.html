                Not Because it is Easy
            </h3>
            <p>
            I’m driving home one night and all the roads are empty. There’s a red light ahead and I slow to a stop underneath it. Looking around, I see the only things moving for miles are some dead leaves blowing across the road. There are no other cars to be found, no reason for my delay. And yet, I still wait there, just as I’m sure most of you would.
            </p>
            <p>
            Why? Because the law clearly says that when the light is red, you stop, and you wait for it to turn green. That’s the law, so, as law abiding citizens, that’s just what we do.
            </p>
            <p>
            And that seems to be how laws generally work. They tell us the things we can’t do and we don’t do those things.
            </p>
            <p>
            But the United States Constitution isn’t like that. Along with its 27 amendments, the constitution tells us the things we can do. We can speak our minds in public forums with no fear of punishment, that’s the first amendment. We can all remain silent if we’re arrested (for, say, running a red light), and then stand for a fair trial. That’s four, five and six, if you’re keeping track. We can choose the people who represent us in government, the people who make those other laws, and if we don’t like how they’re doing, we can replace them, Articles I and II.
            </p>
            <p>
            When the framers of the Constitution handed citizens the ballot, they were also handing them a lot of power. More power than what most people have had for most of human history. They guaranteed that, whatever path the young country would take, it would be the common people who had the ultimate say, and not just an elite ruling class. Now, the definition of who counted as “the people” would grow over the years to include more races and genders and ages than it did initially, we have amendments 15, 19, and 26 to thank for that, but what remained constant from the beginning was the idea. The idea is of a We. The first words of the constitution are we, the people. And, under the constitution, we the people are the ones in control. We hold all the power.
            </p>
            <p>
            We can decide with our voices and our votes what course history will take.
            </p>
            <p>
            That’s the key right there. The Constitution guarantees us the right to be participants of our history. We don’t have to be silent bystanders in our nation’s story, we can be leaders, the ones making the choices.
            </p>
            <p>
            This is a big responsibility, when you consider it. The choices we make, as ordinary people, will be remembered, and have an impact. John F Kennedy was elected in 1960. I did some research and found that, in the county where I live, less than half the population voted in that election. Now, I live in a small county, so that only means about 11,000 votes out of millions cast nationwide but still, elections can come down to thousands or even hundreds of votes. The constitution is prepared for this, of course. If the electoral college is tied, the election is decided in congress. But it’s enough to make you wonder what would have happened if more people had or hadn’t voted, not just in one small county, but all across the country. If enough states had swayed in a different direction, maybe Kennedy would have lost in 1960. Maybe there never would have been a space race, and Neil Armstrong would never have walked on the moon. Or maybe there’s never a Cuban Missile Crisis, and never a war in Vietnam. Sometimes a vote can seem small and insignificant, but its impact can be huge.
            </p>
            <p>
            Democracy is not something you can watch happen. It’s something you work for, something we all have to work for every day. We have a responsibility to live in a way that is deserving of the title American. We are all born or sworn citizens of a republic that has its foundation, not in a royal bloodline or in military might or in a regime of fear, but in us, in that beautiful concept of we the people.
            </p>
            <p>
            We the people of today also have a responsibility to the long history of people that have come before us. It’s a history of sacrifice, of men and women giving their lives to protect the country. The Constitution was written, in part, to provide for the common defense, those words are right in the preamble. Soldiers risking their lives to protect freedom around the world is obviously a central part of this, but the military isn’t our only line of defense. There are social activists, political leaders, everyone who fought or maybe even died for something they believed in. They were all fighting for our common defense. Defense against injustice or prejudice is just as important as defense against terrorism and tyranny. If we at home don’t defend those constitutional ideals, then what does any soldier have left to fight for?
            </p>
            <p>
            The courage of those defenders lies behind every modern political rally and  social movement. Every ballot we cast and every flag we raise, and every time we hear the national anthem played before a baseball game, we owe it to those heroes of the past. Without them, none of this would be possible. We have a great responsibility to our past. Not just to say thank you for our freedom but to use that freedom, to do the things that, because of them, we can.
            </p>
            <p>
            We have a responsibility to cast ballots, and attend rallies, and raise flags. A responsibility to take on the role of the next generation, move our country forward, and to inspire our own change. And I know it’s easier not to. It’s easier to sit at home and shrug and think that things are good enough as they are. But to take a back seat hands off role is to say that the centuries of hard work that brought us here were for nothing. The first amendment guarantees us the right to free speech, but what’s the point if we all leave the speaking out to other people.
            </p>
            <p>
            It’s easy to think that the heroes of our generation will come from somewhere else. We imagine there is some other group out there that will produce great men and women to come down and change the course of history. This group does exist. It’s members include every citizen of the United States of America. With each new generation of Americans comes a new generation of heroes and leaders. Of those who will sacrifice everything to make something. Being in that group isn’t easy. It requires diligence, and selflessness, and heroism. But it’s not something you do because it’s easy. When John F Kennedy challenged Americans of his day to do the impossible and land a man on the moon, he said we as a nation do these things ‘not because they are easy, but because they are hard’. We have a responsibility to do things that aren’t easy. If we don’t make our own sacrifices, then all the sacrifices of the past were wasted.
            </p>
            <p>
            By standing up and speaking out for something, we show that we do not take our past for granted. We realize the opportunity given to us as citizens of the United States comes with the responsibility to use that opportunity. We appreciate the hard work of everyone from the framers onward who made great things happen, and brought us to the point where we can now make even greater things happen.
            </p>
            <p>
            Those greater things lie in our future. The days ahead of us seem challenging and uncertain, but each one is just a page in history waiting to be written by someone. The question is who will write it.
            </p>
            <p>
            This question has only one answer. We will. We all will. We have to. We will write the next chapters of our history, and they will be the greatest chapters yet. To do this we’re going to have to start movements, speak out, and spark change. We’re going to have to do things that aren’t easy.
            </p>
            <p>
            But, after all, we don’t do them because they’re easy.
            </p>
            <p>
            We do them because we have a constitution that says we can.
            </p>
            <p>
            Thank you.
