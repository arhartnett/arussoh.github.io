itchy, and knowing it’s someone else’s only makes it worse. She worked
methodically, the clippers vibrating in her hand. Her arms grew tired and she
paused a minute to stretch her shoulders and keep blood flowing. The whole
time, the kid in her chair stared down at his lap, unresponsive.</span></p>

bottom of your receipt. Bring it in for ten percent off your next cut. My name
is Meredith, and the name of our location is Unisex Hair Palace, Meyers Plaza.”
In the two months since the survey program had started, only one had been
brought back in, by an old woman who hadn’t even wanted the ten percent off,
just to tell to tell her stylist Mindy what a lovely young lady she was. When
the family left, Meredith sat in her chair, watching her two coworkers for the
day fiddle with their combs and scissors. It wasn’t normally a chatty
environment. Each one of them worked off commission and tips, and although the
workplace code of conduct demanded they share clients evenly, there was always competition
over who got which customers.</span></p>

font-family:"Cambria",serif'>As the last few minutes before seven ticked away, Meredith
counted the tips she’d wadded up in her pocket: forty-three dollars. She took
two paper clips from the front desk stowed the money in her bag in two neatly folded
stacks. She pulled her coat over her shoulders and held it closed, the zipper
didn’t work anymore, and walked out to her car.</span></p>

font-family:"Cambria",serif'>The worn seat of her car might as well have been a
block of ice when she fell into it, tossing her bag onto the passenger seat.
She sat there for a full minute in the empty parking lot, watching her breath
spiral in a fog to the windshield where the frost made crystalline rainbows
from the halogen lights outside. It was quiet, most people were home long
before seven this time of winter. The only activity came from the loading dock
behind the grocery store, where a semitrailer fresh in from the supply center
in Butte was dropping off the next day’s wares. </span></p>

font-family:"Cambria",serif'>The car started on the third try, which was typical
given the temperatures, and she eased out of the lot and onto a deserted Main
Street. Her commute was less than five minutes, not nearly enough time for the
heat to do much good, so she spent the drive clutching her broken coat with her
left hand, trying to keep most of the cold air out.</span></p>

reflect against the living room when she pulled into her driveway. Jack didn’t
look up from the screen when she walked in the door, too engrossed in the virtual
war his thumbs were commanding on the old PlayStation. It wasn’t until the gust
of cold air jolted him from his activity that he paused the game.</span></p>

basket and reached into the far right corner until she found what she was
looking for: a box of tampons. Inside, in a few dozen similar wads, was more
than five hundred dollars, mostly in singles. She added the latest ten to the
pile, and put the money back in its hiding place. Two bus tickets to Boise
would be about $120, and she’d found an apartment there with a $300 deposit and
$250 per month rent. She was close.</span></p>

font-family:"Cambria",serif'>Meredith had a double shift that Friday, and it
was good luck because the local high school was having some kind of winter dance
the next day. Her favorite were the boys, who sheepishly asked her to make them
look presentable for their dates, then over tipped because they were awkward
and didn’t know what they were doing. The girls, on the other hand, generally
fussed too much, but at least their hair was softer, and less itchy. She
managed to convince a few young men to buy conditioner, only on the assurance
that it was meant for men, which added a few dollars to her commission for the
day, and hopefully made the job of whoever cut their hair next a little easier.</span></p>

font-family:"Cambria",serif'>She got half an hour for lunch, and spent every
second of it somewhere other than the salon. As soon as the time machine had
finished beeping her into the unpaid half-hour, she was out the door into the
biting cold. She walked down the cracked sidewalk, clutching the thermos of
soup she’d microwaved, while still on the clock, to her chest for warmth. The
hair salon had its own break room, but it smelled like hair and hair product
and Meredith never felt like she was actually taking a break while there. The
grocery store had its own breakroom, where she was headed now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
.5in;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;
font-family:"Cambria",serif'>The door to the breakroom had a window, and
through it she spied Caleb, in his coveralls. Caleb was smaller than most of
the guys who worked at the loading dock, but from Meredith’s experience he was
good with his hands. Really, though, they probably kept him around for his
personality, he had that intangible ability to make a room feel happier. Not to
mention, his foul shooting helped their pickup basketball team against the tire
place at the other end of the shopping plaza.</span></p>

when he saw her through the window. He excused himself and walked out to meet
her.</span></p>

font-family:"Cambria",serif'>Indeed, when they climbed into the black pickup
truck, the air inside was a cozy contrast to the frosty outside. It wasn’t
Caleb’s car, it belonged to the supermarket and Caleb was only supposed to use
it for work related jobs, but no one was coming to check on them at this point
in the day. Caleb spun the radio dial to an oldies station as Meredith
carefully opened her soup in the passenger seat, then he leaned over and gently
kissed her. Jack was a more technically talented kisser than Caleb, but Jack
never bothered to shave and his whiskers ruined the experience. Meredith had
heard all kinds of things about Caleb. It was probably true that he had screwed
half the girls who worked in her salon, but she didn’t mind that especially.</span></p>

font-family:"Cambria",serif'>Meredith had expected to feel more excitement at
this moment, more spontaneity. But she’d been planning and dreaming of it for
so long that it just felt normal. Here she was, running away from her husband
with the man she’d had an affair with, and all she could think of was how tired
she felt. Maybe that’s how it’s supposed to be, she thought. Maybe that meant
it she was confident it was the right thing to do.</span></p>

font-family:"Cambria",serif'>In three months, after both she and Caleb had
started new jobs, him as a short order cook in a diner and her as, once again,
a stylist, though at a nicer salon, Meredith would find out she was pregnant.
Six months after that, the baby would come out with Jack’s black hair instead
of Caleb’s blonde. She would call back to her own house, and get a disconnected
signal. She’d phone around town and eventually find out Jack had killed himself
two weeks after she’d left. She’d also find out from Mrs. Jenkins, who loved to
talk, that the girl whose hair Meredith had ruined had broken up with her
boyfriend at the dance, then had sex with the gym teacher behind the bleachers.
The gym teacher was in jail now, Mrs. Jenkins would say, and the girl had
dropped out of school.</span></p>

font-family:"Cambria",serif'>All these things would happen, but they weren’t a
part of Meredith’s decision as she and Caleb found seats next to each other
before the ten-hour bus ride.</span></p>
