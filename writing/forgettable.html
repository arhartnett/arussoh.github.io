font-family:"Cambria",serif'>The gray-suited men came to town on an otherwise
colorful day. It was early fall, when the air tasted dusty and comfortable. Their
black Escalade slipped quietly down Main Street, passing the grocer, both auto
parts stores, and the tiny library, before crunching to a stop on the shoulder
about two minutes outside town. The men stepped out, chatting cordially, and
walked a short way down the road. They looked out over the red and gold capped
trees that lined the field, but stayed on the asphalt. Their shiny black shoes
were the wrong kind of leather for mud.</span></p>

font-family:"Cambria",serif'>Across the road, Arthur Meyer watched from the
ripped seat of his tractor, an oil stained hat shading his wrinkled face and a
pinch of tobacco in his cheek. He had only driven out that way to watch what
the men were doing. He was too old to use the tractor for any of the farm work
it was meant for. As Arthur watched, a red truck bounced down the road and
parked just behind the black car. Three men in jeans hopped out and set at once
to work, unloading pieces of wood from the truck and hammering them together
until an enormous billboard stood squarely in the middle of the field, facing
the road. </span></p>

font-family:"Cambria",serif'>The air was still sharp with frost when Robert
pulled a pair of dirty work boots over his wool socks, grabbed the leash from
its peg by the door, and took Molly, the farm’s German shepherd, for a walk.
Molly had retired from her days as the barn’s watch dog when Arthur, Robert’s
dad, had sold the last of his cows, counting on fields of corn to pay for his
retirement, or the closest thing to retirement a small-time farmer could hope
for. Even though Molly lived outside, and was allowed to run anywhere on the
farm’s hundred acres, she still liked being taken on walks. Her favorite route,
or rather Robert’s favorite route that Molly didn’t seem to mind, took them
down and across the road and into the old rural cemetery.</span></p>

.5in;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;
font-family:"Cambria",serif'>The cemetery was perched atop, and on two sides
of, a small hill. It had once, presumably, been part of the farm that had
belonged to Tim Shuart. The area had been too steep for the manual tools of the
day, Robert surmised, and long gone generations of farmers had started burying
their family there. A wall had gone up, a few trees had been planted, and they had
a cemetery. No one was being buried there anymore; a much larger, less rustic
cemetery had been incorporated in 1925 on the other side of town. Everyone
buried in the old plot was long gone, their headstones weathered, forgotten.</span></p>

.5in;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;
font-family:"Cambria",serif'>Robert spent most of the walk thinking and kicking
at bits of gravel, and Molly spent it chasing the scent of a squirrel. Neither
noticed the black Escalade snaking its way along the road to their driveway
until they were walking back, and it was parked in the driveway.</span></p>

.5in;line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;
font-family:"Cambria",serif'>Molly started barking as they approached the
house. She smelled the car - new, different, unwanted, before Robert saw it.
When they reached the lawn, Robert unhooked Molly’s leash so she could run off
and play in the field, but Molly stayed, leaning forward slightly, staring
intently at the car.</span></p>

font-family:"Cambria",serif'>Robert pushed the porch door closed behind him and
saw his dad sitting with two of the men in gray suits at the kitchen table. The
men had left their shoes on, Robert noted unhappily. Laid out on the table was
a pile of forms and contracts and laminated maps.</span></p>

Robert’s broad shoulders. “Jobs that are perfect for a guy like you.”</span></p>

fairly recession proof,” said the man in a suit who wasn’t Jeff Flake. “But
unfortunately, they’re also boom proof. Unemployment around here usually stays
at around 20 percent. When your town only has five thousand people, 200 new
jobs can make a big difference.”</span></p>

were more than a century old. The paper was too small, and the library too
underfunded, to warrant microfiche or digital archive, but each issue was

dozen roads in the town, and this was a paper that regularly ran front page
features on a second grade class trip or the start of hunting season, so Robert
was sure he would fine one. It took most of the afternoon, but finally, in June
of 1905, a headline declared “ROAD NAMED FOR LOCAL HERO.” To Robert’s surprise,
the hero was Ida Kobl, not her husband. Ida had, according to the article, been
the first woman in the town’s history to drive an automobile, right down Main
Street, and the town had unanimously agreed on the spot that she deserved to
have her name on something.</span></p>

the library on a larger, nicer piece of paper, straining to make his
handwriting as neat as possible. The next morning, still in the dark, he woke
Molly and set off on their walk, earlier than expected. Molly was a bit bleary
eyed, but followed willingly, always excited to be on a leash.</span></p>

their names again and smiled, thinking of the sepia photograph in the newspaper.
There were well over a hundred other headstones, just like the Kobl’s. Not all
of them had been famous enough to get roads named after them. But they had all
lived in the town and, presumably, had done something at some point in their
lives. </span></p>

and rushed off to the library. Chronologically seemed the best way to find all
the names he’d written down, starting from the oldest name’s birth and working
toward the youngest’s death. He pulled the handle of the painted wooden door, but
it was locked. The lights were off. The parking lot was empty. It was Sunday.
Nearly everything in the town was closed on Sunday. Arthur had been a
traditional farmer, but wasn’t religious, so Robert was raised with no
understanding of why Sunday was any different from an ordinary day.</span></p>

and most of the days after that. They developed a better system, grouping names

much longer. Where Robert’s notes had focused on who the person was to the

a broken heart two days before her husband returned, unexpectedly alive, from the
war (or at least that’s how the headlines told it, a gossip column written a
month later hinted that there might have been an affair involved, possibly
murder). </span></p>

barley farmer who’d bet his friends he could climb the silo without any rope,
and lost. They recorded every story on and stored them in the steadily
fattening book. They worked well together, picking up where the other left off,
swapping papers and continuing the narrative. People who had been forgotten for
years suddenly sprang back into existence, estranged from those who had known
them as mother or sister, but now connected to two people who knew them only
through words and, rarely, photographs.</span></p>

to work on from time to time. Occasionally, he’d recognize a name as a great
grandfather of some childhood friend, but mostly he just puttered around the
house, enjoying his feeling of liberation from owning the farm. There was a free
room in the senior center, which Arthur described as “the single most exciting
place he could imagine living.” It made sense. There were people there to cook
meals and to clean the bathrooms, and there were people there who liked to
spend whole afternoons playing blackjack. Most importantly, there was no
manure. On a Wednesday in mid-March, Robert helped his dad move in. As Robert
walked down the carpeted hall, carrying a stack of old travel magazines his dad
wouldn’t throw out, he heard some of the ladies say to one another, too old to
whisper, “that’s the young man who’s always fiddling in the library.” “He’s the

in a thick, leather bound journal. They didn’t know what to do with their list.
They thought about publishing some of the more exciting stories in the local
paper, or tracking down the descendants of those who’d had families, but
choosing people like that seemed unfair. It was enough that the two of them
remembered.</span></p>
